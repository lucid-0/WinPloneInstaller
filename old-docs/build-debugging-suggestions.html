<p>When building the Windows Plone Installer there are some things to keep in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any error outputs from PyInstaller that seem to be involved with your Python code can be addressed more directly by trying to run the script directly in Python.</li>
<li>The Windows registry effects the environment! If you are having trouble building, try deleting the PloneInstaller key using regedit and see if you get a different result.</li>
</ul>
