<h1 id="windows-subsystem-for-linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</h1>

<p>Since the Anniversary Update, there has been a Linux subsystem available for Windows 10. Since we have a nice Linux-based universal installer for Plone, this subsystem is an easy route to a Windows instance of Plone.</p>

<p><a href="enableWSL.html">enableWSL.ps1</a> and <a href="installWSL.html">installWSL.ps1</a> are PowerShell scripts dealing with getting WSL on the user’s machine, when <a href="plone-bash.html">plone.sh</a> is a Bash script which is called on WSL after it is installed.</p>

<p>Check out Microsoft’s overview of WSL <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about">here</a>.</p>
