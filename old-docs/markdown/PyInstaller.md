# PyInstaller

PyInstaller is a convenient program that takes a Python script as input and produces an executable with integrated dependencies as its output. When run on Windows 10 with [WinPyInstaller.py](WinPyInstaller.html), we get /dist/WinPyInstaller.exe in our project folder. The project owes a lot to [PyInstaller.org](http:\\pyinstaller.org).

See the official [PyInstaller Documentation](http://www.pyinstaller.org/documentation.html).
