#Chocolatey
Chocolatey is a software package manager for Windows. The Plone installer uses it for machine's that cannot run WSL or opt out of doing so. It downloads and installs dependencies like Python before we continue the standard buildout installation process for Plone.

See the official documentation for Chocolate [here](https://chocolatey.org/docs).
