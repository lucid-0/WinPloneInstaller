Steps for creating installer EXE with PyInstaller
	Get python (3.5 seems to work best)
	Make sure pip is installed and accessible from powershell
	Run "pip install pyinstaller"
	Be sure python-tk package is installed for GUI (hit and miss for me whether I had to do this manually)
	Run build.ps1 in powershell
