Windows Subsystem for Linux
===========================

Since the Anniversary Update, there has been a Linux subsystem available for Windows 10. Since we have a nice Linux-based universal installer for Plone, this subsystem is an easy route to a Windows instance of Plone.

:ref:`enablewsl` and :ref:`installwsl` are PowerShell scripts dealing with getting WSL on the user's machine, and :ref:`plone-bash' is a Bash script which is called within WSL after it is installed.
