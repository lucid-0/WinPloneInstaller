Windows Subsystem for Linux
===========================

Since the Anniversary Update, there has been a Linux subsystem available for Windows 10. Since we have a nice Linux-based universal installer for Plone, this subsystem is an easy route to a Windows instance of Plone.

`enableWSL.ps1 <https://github.com/lucid-0/WinPloneInstaller/wiki/enableWSL.ps1>`_ and `installWSL.ps1 <https://github.com/lucid-0/WinPloneInstaller/wiki/installWSL.ps1>`_ are PowerShell scripts dealing with getting WSL on the user's machine, and `plone.sh <https://github.com/lucid-0/WinPloneInstaller/wiki/plone.sh>`_ is a Bash script which is called within WSL after it is installed.
