# Windows Subsystem for Linux

Since the Anniversary Update, there has been a Linux subsystem available for Windows 10. Since we have a nice Linux-based universal installer for Plone, this subsystem is an easy route to a Windows instance of Plone.

[enableWSL.ps1](enableWSL.html) and [installWSL.ps1](installWSL.html) are PowerShell scripts dealing with getting WSL on the user's machine, when [plone.sh](plone-bash.html) is a Bash script which is called on WSL after it is installed.

Check out Microsoft's overview of WSL [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).
