PyInstaller
===========

PyInstaller is a convenient program that takes a Python script as input and produces an executable with integrated dependencies as its output. When run on Windows 10 with :ref:`winploneinstaller`, we get /dist/WinPyInstaller.exe in our project folder. The project owes a lot to [PyInstaller.org](http:\\pyinstaller.org).

Try using :ref:`build` if you would like to include important options in the call to PyInstaller.
