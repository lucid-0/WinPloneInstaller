Using the Installer
===================

The Windows installer for Plone is rather straight forward and should not require much more from the user than double-clicking the Plone icon (the executable) and clicking "Okay."
When the default options are used (including automatic restart), be sure to watch/listen for notification from the installer when it is about to restart your machine in case you are doing other work.

In any case, there are a few configurations options.
All options are active by default. Uncheck the box if you'd like to deactivate them

For Windows 7/8 Users (or Windows 10 prior to the Creator's Update)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Choose whether to add a desktop icon for Starting Plone
* Choose to install in the default directory (C:\Program Files\Plone) or be prompted to select a directory


For Windows 10 Users (with the Creator's Update)
------------------------------------------------

* Choose whether to add a desktop icon for Starting Plone
* Choose whether to use the default username and password for Plone (Admin, Admin) or be prompted

Beyond these simple options, installation should be automatic.

If you chose not to add the Desktop icon, you can start Plone manually.
